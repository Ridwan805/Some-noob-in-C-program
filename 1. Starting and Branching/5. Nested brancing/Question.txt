1. Write a Python program to compute and display a person’s weekly salary as determined by the 
following conditions:
    ● If the hours worked is less than or equal to 40, then the person receives Tk 200 per hour.
    ● If the hours worked is greater than 40, then the person receives Tk 8000 plus Tk 300 for 
each hour worked over 40 hours.
The program should request the hours worked as an input from the user and display the salary as 
output. You need to make sure that user input is valid. For example, a person cannot work for -5 
hours or more than 168 hours in a week. So, the valid hours range is 0 to 168. For invalid hours, 
print outputs as given in the samples below.

2.  Write a Python program that takes an hour from the user as input and tells it is time for which 
meal.
        • The user will input the number in a 24-hour format. So, 14 means 2 pm, 3 means 3 am, 18 
        means 6 pm, etc.
        • Valid inputs are 0 to 23. Inputs less than 0 or more than 23 are invalid in 24-hour clock.
        • Assume, input will be whole numbers. For example, 3.5 will NOT be given as input.  

3.Write the Python code of a program that reads a student’s mark for a single subject, and prints out 
the corresponding grade for that mark. The mark ranges and corresponding grades are shown in 
the table below. You need to make sure that the mark is valid. For example, a student cannot 
receive -5 or 110 marks. So, the valid marks range from 0 to 100.

Marks         Grade
90 or above      A
80-89            B
70-79            C
60-69            D
50-59            E
Below 50         F


4. Suppose, your friend is building an automated car called “Besla”. He needs to fix the programming 
of the car so that it runs at a proper speed. Now, write a python program that takes 2 inputs (distance 
in meters and time in seconds). The program should then print the velocity in kilometers per hour 
of that car. Also, it should print whether the car is working properly based on the following chart.
Velocity                                 Information to be printed
Less than 60 km/h                       Too slow. Needs more changes.
Between 60 km/h to 90 km/h              Velocity is okay. The car is ready!
Greater than 90 km/h                 Too fast. Only a few changes should suffice.

5.Write a python program that takes the CGPA and no of credits completed by a student and prints 
whether the student is eligible for a waiver and of what percentage.
To be eligible for a waiver, a student must have completed at least 30 credits and earned a CGPA 
greater or equal to 3.8. If not, please print "The student is not eligible for a waiver".
CGPA                            Waiver percentage
3.80 - 3.89                         25 percent
3.90 - 3.94                         50 percent
3.95 - 3.99                         75 percent
4.00                                100 percent
